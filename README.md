I've never had a chance to learn OS during my undegraduate studies. Given my plan of becoming a Cloud Systems Engineer (eg. creating AWS systems)
I'm planning to enroll in "CSE290E - Virtualization" at UCSD. To take most out of this course, I decided to firstly fill my gaps in knowledge.
In this repo I'll include all of the HWs and Projects for the [Berkeley's CS162 course](https://cs162.org/). [Lecture recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF2K2xZjNEf97A_uBCwEl61sdxWVP7VWC)
